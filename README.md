# Compare the Triplets

Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

The rating for Alice's challenge is the triplet a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]), and the rating for Bob's challenge is the triplet b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).

The task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], and a[2] with b[2].

If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.<br/>
If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.<br/>
If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.<br/>

Comparison points is the total points a person earned.<br/>
Given a and b, determine their respective comparison points.<br/>

### Example

a = [1, 2, 3]<br/>
b = [3, 2, 1]<br/>

&#x2022; For elements *0*, Bob is awarded a point because a[0] .
&#x2022; For the equal elements a[1] and b[1], no points are earned.
&#x2022; Finally, for elements 2, a[2] > b[2] so Alice receives a point.

The return array is [1, 1] with Alice's score first and Bob's second.

## Function Description

Complete the function compareTriplets in the editor below.

compareTriplets has the following parameter(s):

&#x2022; int a[3]: Alice's challenge rating<br/>
&#x2022; int b[3]: Bob's challenge rating

### Return

&#x2022; int[2]: Alice's score is in the first position, and Bob's score is in the second.

### Input Format

The first line contains 3 space-separated integers, a[0], a[1], and a[2], the respective values in triplet a.<br/>
The second line contains 3 space-separated integers, b[0], b[1], and b[2], the respective values in triplet b.

## Constraints

&#x2022; 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100<br/>
&#x2022; 1 ≤ b[i] ≤ 100

#### More Explanation:

In this example:

&#x2022; a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]) = (5, 6, 7)<br/>
&#x2022; b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]) = (3, 6, 10)

Now, let's compare each individual score:

&#x2022; a[0] > b[0], so Alice receives 1 point.<br/>
&#x2022; a[1] = b[1], so nobody receives a point.<br/>
&#x2022; a[2] = b[2], so Bob receives 1 point.<br/>

Alice's comparison score is 1, and Bob's comparison score is 1. Thus, we return the array [1,1].
