# Number Line Jumps

You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act, you are given two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity).

- The first kangaroo starts at location x1 and moves at a rate of v1 meters per jump.
- The second kangaroo starts at location x2 and moves at a rate of v2 meters per jump.
You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time as part of the show. If it is possible, return YES, otherwise return NO.

Example
<code>
x1 = 2
v1 = 1
x2 = 1
v2 = 2
</code>

After one jump, they are both at <code>x = 3</code>, (<code>x1 + v1 = 2 + 1</code>,<code>x2 + v2 = 1 + 2</code>), so the answer is YES.

## Function Description

Complete the function kangaroo in the editor below.

kangaroo has the following parameter(s):

- int x1, int v1: starting position and jump distance for kangaroo 1
- int x2, int v2: starting position and jump distance for kangaroo 2

### Returns

- string: either YES or NO

### Input Format

A single line of four space-separated integers denoting the respective values of x1, v1, x2, and v2.

### Constraints

- <code>0 <= x1 < x2 <= 10000</code>
- <code>1 <= v1 <= 10000</code>
- <code>1 <= v2 <= 10000</code>
